# Project-10---Clone-Computer-Vision
This project implements an advanced real-time 3D pose tracking system using MediaPipe and OpenCV technologies. The system captures human poses through webcam input and creates a dynamic visual representation with neon-colored skeletal overlays and gradient effects. Key features include real-time pose landmark detection, 3D visualization with matplotlib, motion trail tracking, and synchronized 2D-3D pose rendering. The application employs sophisticated visual effects including gradient color transitions, pulsing animations, and smooth line drawing techniques. The system maintains optimal performance through frame rate optimization and selective 3D plot updates. This technology demonstrates practical applications in motion capture, fitness tracking, and interactive entertainment systems, providing an engaging user experience through its futuristic visual interface.
